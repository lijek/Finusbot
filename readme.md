# This is my Discord bot.
To make it work you must install the **discord.js** library using npm.
The bot is fairly basic and does not have a lot of functionality.
I made it for fun, it has some errors probably, but it does work.
I won't update it ver often, it is here to be a backup if my hard drive fails.
Thank you for looking in here!
